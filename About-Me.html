                        <p>
                            My name is Elijah Johnson and I am a senior at Hunter College. <br>My major is in Emerging Media,
                            although it used to be in Computer Science. I changed it about two years ago when I realized
                            that it wouldn't really be a good fit for me, and I was losing interest in the program.<br>Luckily,
                            I've already taken some web programming before, so I know about most of the basics already. <br>For my
                            future career, I think I want to do something in the marketing field, or just something that has
                            to do with media in general. <br>I've always had wide array of interests when it comes to visual,
                            auditory, and digital media, so I figure something that that involves anyone of those would be
                            fine with me. <br>I have a heavy interest in video games, music, movies, and anime at the moment,
                            and I don't really see that ever changing. Something that dealt with any of those would be
                            amazing to me.
