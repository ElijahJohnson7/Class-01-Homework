# Class-01-Homework

So for my project I primarily just listed off different facts about myself that I think would be interesting to someone who doesn't really know me, and then added a few other things that were in the requirements. Along with the main text itself, I included an art adaptation of myself for the image, music that plays automatically upon the site loading, and a hyperlink for my Instagram at the bottom. I had already went into the assignment knowing how I generally wanted the page to be formatted and presented, so I mainly just had to organize everything together. In the code itself, I used a style element early on to allow me to center the image that I was using. I could've just centered the image exclusively instead of making it universal for the entire code, but since there was only a single picture it didn't really matter as much. I also did the same thing for the first heading, by placing it within the same style block. In the body of the code, I had several sections. I used one for the primary text, another for the image and music, and another for the link near the end. The one thing that kind of tripped me up while I was working on this was when I was trying to mess around with the audio player. I wanted it to play the audio automatically upon loading the site but hide the player to make it have a cleaner presentation. I managed to figure out how to do it by just looking it up a few times though.
